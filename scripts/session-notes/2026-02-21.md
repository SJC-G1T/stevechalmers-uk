# Session Notes — 2026-02-21

## What was built

### Homepage — stevechalmers.uk
- Single `index.html` with full design system (Space Grotesk, dark theme, rose-pink accent)
- **Visual effects:**
  - Animated canvas dot field in hero (fades on scroll)
  - Mouse-tracked rose glow overlay (smooth lerp)
  - Hero parallax (eyebrow/h1/p at different scroll speeds)
  - Frosted glass nav that activates after 60px scroll
  - IntersectionObserver card reveal animations with stagger
- **About section:** circular B&W headshot (93KB JPEG compressed from 5MB PNG), Gemini watermark cropped via `object-position`
- All effects disabled for `prefers-reduced-motion` and touch/mobile devices

### Coffee Brew Calculator — stevechalmers.uk/coffee
- Single `/coffee/index.html` — all 5 brew methods (V60, French Press, AeroPress, Moka Pot, Chemex)
- Ratio display (live-updates as you type), step-by-step instructions per method
- "Save my ratio" — localStorage persistence, pre-fills on return
- Share button — native share API with clipboard fallback
- PWA: `manifest.json` + `sw.js` (offline capable, add-to-home-screen)

### Support files
- `scripts/app-plan.md` — 6-app roadmap (coffee, pace, debt, watch, matchday, budget)
- `scripts/social/coffee-launch-posts.md` — 3 launch week posts (Mon/Wed/Fri)
- `scripts/social/content-strategy.md` — 12-week content plan
- `scripts/social/post-template.md` — reusable template for future app ships

## What's live
- GitHub repo: https://github.com/SJC-G1T/stevechalmers-uk
- Cloudflare Pages: https://stevechalmers-uk.pages.dev (live)
- Custom domain: stevechalmers.uk (DNS configured, SSL cert provisioning — active within ~5 min of this session)
- Auto-deploy: every push to `main` triggers a new Pages deployment

## What Steve needs to do

### Accounts (do once, ~10 min)
See `scripts/social/accounts-to-setup.md` for full instructions:
1. Create Twitter/X account — suggested handle `@stevechalmers`
2. Create Bluesky account — set handle to `stevechalmers.uk` (custom domain handle)
3. Create Buffer account (buffer.com, Essentials ~£5/mo) — connect both accounts
4. Tell Claude the handles so footer links in `index.html` can be updated

### Visual check
- Open stevechalmers.uk in browser — confirm parallax, glow, frosted nav, card reveals, headshot all look right
- Open stevechalmers.uk/coffee — test all 5 brew methods, share button, localStorage save
- Check on mobile: no parallax, cards still animate, nav still frosts

## What's next
- **App 2:** Run Pace Calculator (`/pace`) — target pace, splits, finish time calculator
- Update homepage card when it ships (remove "coming soon" placeholder)
- Post coffee launch content once Twitter/Bluesky accounts are live
