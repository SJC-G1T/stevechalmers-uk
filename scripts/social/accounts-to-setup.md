# Accounts to Set Up — 10-Minute Job

These can't be created by Claude. Do these yourself in one sitting.

---

## 1. Twitter / X
- Go to: x.com → Create account
- **Suggested handle**: `@stevechalmers` (check availability first)
  - Fallbacks: `@stevechalmersuk`, `@schalmers`
- **Bio**: "Senior tech professional. Building small, useful tools in the open using AI. stevechalmers.uk"
- **Profile pic**: Real photo
- **Header**: Leave blank for now or use a simple dark banner
- **Pin**: Your first post after the coffee app ships

---

## 2. Bluesky
- Go to: bsky.app → Create account
- **Handle**: Use your custom domain → set as `stevechalmers.uk` (Bluesky supports this)
  - In Settings → Handle → enter `stevechalmers.uk` and follow the DNS verification steps
  - This means your handle becomes `@stevechalmers.uk` — cleaner than a random bsky handle
- **Bio**: Same as Twitter

---

## 3. Buffer
- Go to: buffer.com → Start free trial → Essentials plan (~£5/month)
- Connect both Twitter and Bluesky accounts
- Set up a posting schedule: Monday, Wednesday, Friday at 8am (your timezone)
- You'll paste the three posts from `scripts/social/coffee-launch-posts.md` into the queue

---

## Once done
Tell Claude the accounts are live and the Twitter/Bluesky handles. The footer links in `index.html` will be updated to point to real URLs.
