## Content principles
- No hype. No "I'm so excited to share..." Just say what you built.
- Every post ends with a link or a CTA — never a vague close.
- Wednesday posts can use real data (Cloudflare Analytics) or honest observations if traffic is low.
- Keep posts under 280 chars where possible for Twitter. Bluesky has 300 char limit.
